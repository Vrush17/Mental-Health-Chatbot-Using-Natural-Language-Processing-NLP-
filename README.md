# Mental-Health-Chatbot-Using-Natural-Language-Processing-NLP-

This project presents an intelligent chatbot designed to support users in discussing mental health concerns using natural, empathetic conversations. Built using state-of-the-art NLP techniques, the chatbot aims to detect user intent, classify emotions, and provide helpful, 

# 1. ABSTRACT:
This project explores the construction of a classification-based mental health chatbot using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques. Rather than generating free-form responses, the chatbot is designed to select the most appropriate reply from a predefined set of responses based on user inputs. Utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Keras tokenization, and pretrained Word2Vec embeddings, the system demonstrates the multiclassification capability of deep learning models in natural language tasks. The project includes comprehensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA) to handle class imbalance, and performance evaluation to ensure robust classification results. This work highlights the power of combining pretrained semantic representations with sequential neural networks to create reliable and empathetic conversational agents, especially in sensitive domains like mental health support.

# 2. INTRODUCTION:
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) are revolutionizing the way machines interact with humans, opening new avenues for creating intelligent conversational agents. This project delves into developing a sophisticated mental health chatbot that leverages the capabilities of deep learning for multiclass text classification.
Unlike generative dialogue systems that create responses word-by-word, the focus of this project is on classification-based response selection. The chatbot does not generate new sentences; instead, it intelligently chooses the best predefined response class that aligns with the user's input. This approach offers greater control, safety, and reliability critical factors when dealing with sensitive subjects like emotional distress and mental well-being.
The backbone of this system is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, chosen for its proven ability to handle sequential data and retain contextual information across long dependencies. The model benefits further from semantic richness by integrating pretrained Word2Vec embeddings, which capture the meanings of words based on their usage in large corpora.

# 3. The objectives of the project are:
• To build a natural language understanding model capable of accurately classifying user inputs into intent categories.
• To implement thorough data preprocessing techniques including tokenization, sequence padding, and semantic embedding.
• To address dataset imbalance through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and augmentation methods.
• To develop and train an LSTM-based classifier for multiclass response selection.
